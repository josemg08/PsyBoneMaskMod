	<description>I forked from https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2885162850 this mod in order to fix and add only the masks. All credit should go to the original artist I just remade the code and updated everything for 1.5.\n\nThis masks provide both Psychic Entropy and Sensitivity. Can be crafted at crafting spot and sculpting table with a human like corpse. Any ideas to make it better or other mask related projects are welcome.</description>
