	<description>I forked from this mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2885162850 in order to fix and add only the masks. All credit should go to the original artist I just remade the code and updated everything for 1.5\nThis masks provide both Psychic Entropy and Sensitivity. Can be crafted at crafting spot and sculpting table with a human like corpse.\nAny ideas to make it better or other mask related projects are welcome.\n\nGithub => https://github.com/josemg08/PsyBoneMaskMod</description>
