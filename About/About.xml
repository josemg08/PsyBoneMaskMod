	<description>This mod introduces new bone masks to Rimworld that offer both Psychic Entropy and Sensitivity. These masks can be crafted at a crafting spot or sculpting table using a human-like corpse.

		Origin and Credits
		This project is a fork of an excellent concept (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2885162850). While the original code was no longer functional, I was highly impressed by the assets. All credit for the stunning artwork goes to the original artist. My contribution involves entirely re-coding and updating the mod for Rimworld 1.5 and 1.6.</description>
