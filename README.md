I forked from this mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2885162850, the code wasn't working but I liked the assets. All credit should go to the original artist I just fixed the code and updated everything for 1.5.

This masks provide both Psychic Entropy and Sensitivity, with each been more potent for one of the two. Can be crafted at crafting spot and sculpting table with a human like corpse.
Any ideas to make it better or other mask related projects are welcome.
