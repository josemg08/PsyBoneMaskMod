About the Mod
This mod introduces new bone masks to Rimworld that offer both Psychic Entropy and Sensitivity. These masks can be crafted at a crafting spot or sculpting table using a human-like corpse.

Origin and Credits
This project is a fork of an excellent concept (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2885162850). While the original code was no longer functional, I was highly impressed by the assets. All credit for the stunning artwork goes to the original artist. My contribution involves entirely re-coding and updating the mod for Rimworld ~~1.5~~ 1.6.

Contribute & Connect
I'm always open to ideas for improving this mod or collaborating on other mask-related projects. Feel free to share your thoughts!
